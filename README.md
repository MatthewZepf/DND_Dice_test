# DND_Dice_test
This is made to settle a debate we had over rolling dice statistics for DND stats

You rolld 4 six sided die drop lowest and you repeat this 6 times. If you do not have 2 16's or above, you scrap all of your rolls and do it again. There was a debate about wether or not you could keep rolling until you got a 16 or above and then roll the remaining 5 and get the same average stats. This simulates both ways 1 million times and shows about a 0.5 average stat difference between the two.
